## Overview

This projects aim to make Cambodia Law Data to be structured and easily
accessed.

To do so, in this project, we split data into various steps:
1. Raw: Original pdf file
2. Semi-structure:
   - include various intermediate data that is generated via tools or manual
   - For example, semi-structure data for Cambodia law includes:
     - list of images generated from the original pdf
     - list of markdown files, containing extracted text using google cloud vision
     - A single clean markdown file combining the autogenerated markdown files
3. Structure:
   - A parser program that parse clean markdown into data that is easily inserted into a database
   - A database structure (use `tag <-> tag_types <-> tag_parent_ids` db structure)
   - Final output is a list of sql files that can be used as seed to a database
4. App:
   - Containing end-user programs such as API server, web frontend, mobile apps etc...

There is also a directory called `tool` that will help converting data into various steps.

```

- convert list of images, to raw md (extracted using google vision)

```sh
